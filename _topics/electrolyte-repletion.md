# K+
- Goal: K+ > 4.0
- For every 10 mEq of K+ given, the serum K+ will rise about 0.1 mEq/L
- Typically use KCl for repletion (1 mEq of KCL = 1 mEq K+)
- Can also use KPO4 for repletion (3 mmols KPO4 = 4.4 mEq K+)
- Maximum infusion rate via peripheral line is 10 mEq/hour
- Maximum infusion rate via central line is 20 mEq/hour

# Mg
- Goal: Mg > 2.0
- For every 1 g of MgSO4, the serum Mg will rise about 0.1-0.2 mg/dL
- Usually given as MgSO4 2 g IV over 1 hr
- If Mg > 1.5 given one 2 g dose, if <1.5 give 2 doses of 2 g each

# Phos
- Goal: Phos > 3.5
- Replacement must be ordered in mmol of phosphorus
- Can use KPhos or NaPhos depending on other lytes
- Maximum infusion rate of KPhos is 10 mmol/hr
- If Phos is >2, give 15 mmol of IV Phos over 4 hr
- If Phos is <2, give 21 mmol of IV Phos over 4 hr
- If Phos is <1, give 30 mmol of IV Phos over 4 hr
