# Common case: Spinal cord injury/spinal fracture

## History
- Timing
- Mechanism
- Neuro deficit and trend
- Point tenderness and/or rectal tone on Trauma primary survey?
- Catalog of injuries
- History of spinal instrumentation?
- History of anticoagulation

## Labs
- Pre-op labs
- Tox screen
- EtOH level

## Imaging
- Full spine CT
- Check coronal, sagittal and axial images.
- Fractures? See below for types and management of spinal fractures.
  - Fracture near foramen transversarium: CTA for dissection
- Check:
  - OA distance (see below ?C-spine injury types?)
  - Atlanto-dentine interval (see below ?C-spine injury types?)
  - ALL, PLL, spinal laminal line
  - Fish-mouthing of disk spaces
  - Epidural hematoma.
- MR for neuro deficit with no obvious cause: eval acute disk herniation, epidural hematoma, cord signal change, ligamentous injury.

## Plan
- Consider fracture type (see below). External stabilization v. internal fixation?
- If Neuro-deficit, consider stability for stat MRI versus fracture type requiring operative treatment.
- Cervical fracture: refer to SLIC scale to help guide management
- Thoracolumbar fracture: refer to TLICS to help guide management
- Ankylosing spondylitis type patients: High risk of epidural hematoma.
- Spinal cord injury
  - MAP goal 85-90 x 7 days, need arterial line. (Also see below, ?Neurogenic shock?)
  - PM&R consult
  - Currently no evidence for steroids
    - If giving steroids, must be within 8 hours of injury
    - Bolus 30mg/kg IV over 15 minutes (62.5 mg/mL solution).
    - Then 45 min pause
    - Maintenance rate 5.4 mg/kg/h
  - If started within 3 hours of injury, continue for 23 hours
  - If started between 3-8 hours of injury, continue for 47 hours
    - Study exclusions: cauda equina syndrome, gunshot wounds (worse outcome), life threatening morbidity, pregnancy, narcotic addiction, age <13 y/o, already on maintenance steroids.

# Spinal cord injury

## ABCs

## ASIA score: Prefer to examine at 72h.
A = Complete. Sensory and motor all lost, no sacral signs.
B = Incomplete. Sensory but no motor preserved more than 3 levels below injury (sacral sensation)
C = Incomplete. Sensory and motor preserved, minimal motor. 0-2/5 strength in more than half of muscles below level.
D = Incomplete. Sensory and motor preserved, functional. 3-5/5 in more than half of muscles below level.
E = Normal, return of all sensory/motor function.

# C-spine injury
from Neurosurgery, March 2013
- Airway: maintain immobilization with intubation
- Breathing: consider paralysis of intercostals/diaphragm with hypoventilation
- Circulation: Consider spinal shock with hemorrhagic/cardiogenic shock.
  - MAP goal 85-90 mmHg x 7 days
- Complete trauma eval
  - Exam: ASIA score (see above)
    - Determine most caudal sensory and motor level for both L and R. Most caudal motor with at least 3/5 strength.
    - Complete: no motor or sensory function extends to sacral segments
    - Incomplete: Any motor or sensory function including sacral segments (voluntary contraction or sensation during DRE. Bulbocavernosus reflex no voluntary).
- CT total spine. (Plain films AP/lat C spine and T/L spine if too unstable for CT and headed for emergent OR).
- NO STEROIDS
- Consider CTA/MRA eval carotids and verts.
- Cervical immobilization
  - Awake, asymptomatic patient = no imaging, no immobilization
    - No midline neck pain
    - Normal neurologic exam
    - No distracting injury
    - No pain with full ROM exam
  - Awake symptomatic patient and CT negative
    - Can d/c C collar after normal flex-ex films
    - Option to d/c C collar with normal MRI within 48h of injury
  - Obtunded/unevaluable patient and CT negative
    - Option to d/c C collar with normal MRI within 48h of injury
    - D/c C collar per Trauma protocol
- Closed reduction
  - Contraindications:
    - Extension-distraction injury (ankylosing spondylitis)
    - Local infection
    - Comminuted skull fracture
    - Hemodynamically unstable
    - Atlanto-occipital dislocations
    - Depressed LOC
  - Do not attempt in patients with additional rostral injury or unreliable neurologic exam/intoxication.
  - Halo or Gardner-Wells tongs with X-ray/fluoro guidance
    - Start with 3 lb traction per injury level.
    - Add weight every 10-15 min
    - Serial neuro exams and lateral C spine films with each weight
  - 2-4% transient neurologic complication, 1% risk permanent neurologic complication
  - If fail closed reduction get MR before open procedure

# Cervical Spine Traction
- Frame placement
  - Call for appropriate bed, weights and pulleys (clerks or call patient equipment)
  - Call O&P
  - Inject lidocaine at anticipated pin sites
  - Anterior pins over lateral 1/3 of eyebrow (avoid supratrochlear n)
  - Posterior pins about 1cm above pinna in line with EAM
    - Posterior pin placement will provide flexion
    - Anterior pin placement will provide extension
  - Ensure frame does not touch ears
  - Tighten pins stepwise, gradually in opposing fashion to avoid torqueing
- Get X-ray/fluoro
- Add weights
  - Align traction axially along spinal column straight back.
  - Start 10 lbs
  - Usually add 5 lbs per level. Change every 20-30 minutes at 5-10 lb intervals
  - Neuro exam before and after each change in weights.
  - Confirm on X ray
  - Can give valium for musc
