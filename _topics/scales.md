# Glasgow Coma Scale for TBI

- Eyes
  1. Does not open eyes
  2. Opens to pain
  3. Opens to voice
- Voice
  1. No response
  2. Incoherent sounds
  3. Inappropriate words
  4. Confused
  5. Oriented to person, place, time
- Motor
  1. No movement
  2. Extensor posturing (decerebrate)
  3. Flexion posturing (decorticate, tripleflex*)
  4. Withdraw from pain
  5. Localize
  6. Follows commands

Use "1T" to indicate trach'd and unable to talk, but can use higher numbers if
able to communicate despite trach.

*Withdraw is sustained while stimulus is present; tripleflex is a brief reflex
despite continued painful stimulus.

Range: 3-15

# Hunt & Hess for SAH

0. Normal
1. Asymptomatic, mild headache, slight nuchal rigidity
2. Moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than cranial nerve palsy
3. Drowsiness, confusion, mild focal neurologic deficit
4. Stupor, moderate-severe hemiparesis
5. Coma, decerebrate posturing
{: start="0"}

Range: 0-5

# ICH

- +1 for age > 80
- +2 for GCS 3-4
- +1 for GCS 5-12
- +0 for GCS 13-15
- +1 if intraventricular blood
- +1 if volume >30cc
- +1 if infratentorial

Range: 0-6


# Spetzler-Martin for AVMs

- +1 if deep venous drainage
- +1 if eloquent cortex (language, vision, brainstem, i.e. high price real-estate)
- +3 if any dimension >6cm
- +2 if any dimension 3-6cm
- +1 if all dimensions <3cm

Range: 1-5

# House-Brackmann for facial nerve palsy

- Grade I - Normal
  - Normal facial function in all areas
- Grade II - Slight Dysfunction
  - Gross: slight weakness noticeable on close inspection; may have very slight synkinesis
  - At rest: normal symmetry and tone
  - Motion: forehead - moderate to good function; eye - complete closure with minimum effort; mouth - slight asymmetry.
- Grade III - Moderate Dysfunction
  - Gross: obvious but not disfiguring difference between two sides; noticeable but not severe synkinesis, contracture, and/or hemi-facial spasm.
  - At rest: normal symmetry and tone
  - Motion: forehead - slight to moderate movement; eye - complete closure with effort; mouth - slightly weak with maximum effort.
- Grade IV - Moderate Severe Dysfunction
  - Gross: obvious weakness and/or disfiguring asymmetry
  - At rest: normal symmetry and tone
  - Motion: forehead - none; eye - incomplete closure; mouth - asymmetric with maximum effort.
- Grade V - Severe Dysfunction
  - Gross: only barely perceptible motion
  - At rest: asymmetry
  - Motion: forehead - none; eye - incomplete closure; mouth - slight movement
- Grade VI - Total Paralysis
  - No movement
