# Head Trauma

## History:

- Time of injury
- Mechanism of injury
- Medications given en route
- Seizure, LOC
- Anticoagulant/antiplatelet

## Exam:

- GCS
- Pupils, cranial nerves (esp 3, 6, 7, 12)
- Strength, sensation, mental status
- Raccoon eyes, battle sign, hemotympanum, CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea
- Scalp lacerations

## Imaging: Head and C-spine CT

- Always check entire head CT for epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, parenchymal blood
- Midline shift, hydrocephalus, basal cisterns/subarachnoid spaces patent, gray/white differentiation
- Bone windows: Skull fractures? Fractures near carotids/temporal bone? Posterior frontal sinus? Orbits?
- Alignment of cervical spine/fractures. Facet dislocations? Teardrop fractures? Fishmouthing of disc spaces or spinous processes?

## Labs:

- Full set of labs, +/- tox screen/EtoH if older

## Plan:

- ABC's
- Does the patient need to go to the OR (?epidural hematoma +/-shift, subdural blood +/-mass effect, open/depressed skull fracture)
- Obtain CTA if fracture through carotid canal or foramen transversarium
- usually will have spine precautions until final CT review by attending radiologist (if no fracture)
- admit to ICU for 24 hours.  Floor for neuro-intact non-displaced skull fractures.
- If GCS less than 8, consider invasive ICP monitoring (make sure to have ICP monitor and box ready if can?t hit ventricle with ventric).  Goal CPP > 60, ICP < 25 (CPP = MAP ? ICP). See below for indications for invasive ICP monitoring
- HOB at 30 degrees (reverse Trendelenberg if spine not cleared)
- Avoid hypotonic solutions
- pCO2 goal 30-35 mmHg
- pO2 >100 mmHg
- cooling blanket for fever
- q 1 hour neuro checks
- Na >135
- Normalize PT, PTT and platelets > 80,000
- Anticonvulsant x 1 week if depressed skull fracture, immediate post-traumatic seizure, penetrating brain injury, or intracranial blood (Keppra 500 mg BID or 10 mg/kg BID)
- Page neurosurgery for change in neuro exam or elevated ICP


# Head Injury

## ABCs

## GCS
- Mild (GCS 14-15)
- Moderate (GCS 9-13)
- Severe (GCS <8)

## TBI Guidelines:
- No steroids
- Goal SBP >90
- Goal O2 sat>90% or PaO2 >60
- Goal ICP <20-25 (Goal CPP 50-70)
- Goal SjO2 >50%, PbrO2>15 (ischemia at 8-12)
- Goal Normothermia
- Goal PaCO2 35. Hyperventilate only as temporizing measure.
- Mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg. Contraindic in hypotension, renal failure.
- Hypertonic saline. Caution in heart failure/pulmonary edema. 250-500cc 3% NaCl or 30cc 23.4% NaCl, prefer via central line.
- Prefer propofol 20-75 mcg/kg/min (caution hypotension) and fentanyl 2-5 mcg/kg/h (caution hypotension, increased ICP)
- Thiopental coma: Load 10mg/kg over 30 min then 5mg/kg q1h x 3 doses. Titrate to burst suppression (1-2 mg/kg/h maintenance).
- +/- Keppra x 7 days, dec early seizures but seizures do not affect outcomes
- Feeds at goal by day 7, glycemic control.
- SCDs. SQH or Lovenox OK 24h after injury if bleeding stable.



# ICP monitoring

- GCS <8 and abn CT **OR**
- GCS <8 and normal CT and 2 or more:
  - Age >40
  - SBP<90
  - Posturing


## Ventriculostomy

- Kocher's point:
  - 10.5 cm from glabella, 2.5 cm from midline (roughly midpupillary line).
  - Aim toward intersection of medial canthus and tragus (perpendicular to skull).
  - Advance to 5-7 cm.
- Occipito-parietal site:
  - Frazier burr hole: 3.5cm from midline, 6.5 cm above inion.
  - Also intersection of midpupillary line with horizontal line from top of pinna
  - Aim for middle of forehead or ipsilateral medial canthus
  - Use stylet for 6cm to avoid getting into temporal horn. Then advance to 10-12 cm. For infants only 7-8cm.




## Epidural hematoma
- Does not cross sutures, can cross midline. Swirl sign = active bleeding
- Usually associated with skull fractures (70-95%)
  - Middle meningeal artery or vein, also diploic veins and venous sinuses.
- Decompression if:
  - &gt;30 cm3 regardless of GCS
  - Neurologic deficit (operate within 70 min of pupillary dilatation!)
  - &gt;15mm thickness or >5mm midline shift
  - Brainstem distortion, low threshold for surgery in temporal location
- Consider conservative mgmt. if <30 cm3 AND <15mm thick AND <5mm shift with no focal deficit and GCS >8
  - Q1h neuro checks
  - Serial CT q 6-8h
- Mortality 10% for all operative EDH cases

## Subdural hematoma
- Can cross sutures, does not cross midline
- Acute if within 14 days of head injury
- Decompression if:
  - &gt;1 cm thickness or >5mm midline shift
  - Neurologic deficit
  - Decline in GCS of 2+ points between time of injury and hospital admission
  - Decompress within 2-4 hours for better outcome.
- Consider hemicraniectomy if associated parenchymal injury
- Mortality 40-60% for all operative acute SDH cases. Worse outcome if age >70 and GCS <9

## Cerebral contusion
- Surgical decompression:
  - Any lesion >50 cm3
  - Frontal or temporal lesion >20 cm3 with >5mm midline shift or cisternal compression.
  - Consider decompression for neurologic decline or intractable ICP.
- Medically refractory cerebral edema
  - Bifrontal craniectomy within 48 hours for diffuse injury
  - Subtemporal decompression, temporal lobectomy
  - Decompressive hemicraniectomy for hemispheric lesion

## Posterior fossa hematomas
- Early, aggressive approach. Can decompensate quickliy.
- Surgical decompression:
  - Distortion/obliteration of 4th ventricle, loss of basal cisterns or obstructive hydrocephalus
  - Neurologic deficit
- Consider conservative management if no significant mass effect and no neurologic dysfunction
  - Neuro checks q1h and serial CTs

## Traumatic SAH
- Consider  Keppra 7 days
- Q1h neuro checks
- Correct coagulopathy (see Coagulopathy in Neurocritical care)
- Repeat head CT in 6-8 hours. Lovenox OK if CT stable.

## Penetrating brain injury
- Prophylactic antibiotics recommended
- Antiseizure prophylaxis recommended x 1 week
- Early ICP monitoring recommended if unable to follow exam
- Surgical correction of persistent CSF leaks, hematomas with mass
  effect. Avoid entry/exit site in incision.  Debridement of nonviable
  scalp/bone/dura. Watertight repair of nasal sinus injuries.
- Conservative debridement of missile tract without retrieval of remote
  fragments (remove if fragment movement, abscess formation, vascular
  compression, obstructive hydrocephalus, heavy metals in CSF).
- CTA or angio for vascular inury (consider angio for penetration injury
  through pterion, or bit or posterior fossa; penetrating fragment with ICH;
  pseudoaneurysm during surgical exploration; GCS<8 with penetrating injury;
  TCDs/CTA suggestive of vasospasm)

## Skull fractures
- Linear non-displaced
  - Consider possibility of venous sinus thrombosis or arterial dissection
  - See peds section re: growing skull fracture in peds.
  - Diastatic: separation of cranial sutures
- Open skull fracture
  - Consider conservative management if:
    - No evidence dural penetration
    - No significant intracranial hematoma
    - No depression <1cm or cosmetic deformity
    - No frontal sinus involvement
    - No pneumocephalus or gross wound contamination
  - Operative mgmt for open skull fractures depressed with outer table of fragment past inner table of skull
- Depressed/Comminuted
  - Eval for underlying injury
  - Elevate for outer table of fragment past inner table of skull.
- Compound: communication with skull base, paranasal sinuses, overlying scalp.
  - Criteria for emergent operation:
    - Open contaminated wound
    - Hematoma and/or dural laceration
  - Elective repair if closed and no mass effect/neurologic compromise
- Skull base fractures:
  - Signs: Raccoon eyes, anosmia, rhinorrhea, otorrhea, hemotympanum, Battle?s sign, CN VII or VIII palsy.
    - Can test fluid for ring sign or dipstick glucose.
  - No CSF leak: observe 2-3 days
  - CSF leak:
    - Most resolve spont within 1 week.
    - May trial lumbar drainage with HOB up (watch for pneumocephalus)
    - Surgical closure for refractory CSF leak (can use intrathecal contrast to localize leak)
  - Temporal bone:
    - Longitudinal: risk to eardrum, EAC, otorrhea
    - Transverse: risk to middle ear, facial nerve.
    - Facial palsy: high dose steroids and possible surgical
      decompression/graft. Steroids for delayed facial palsy.
- Maxillofacial
  - Emergent intervention for aiway obstruction/aspiration or severe hemorrhage
  - Frontal and supraorbital
    - Suspect CSF leak.
    - Supraorbital fractures may require fixation for cranial nerve
      compression or globe compression
    - Frontal sinus:
    - Anterior wall alone: fix for cosmesis
    - Posterior wall: eval for dural integrity
    - Ant and post: may require visual inspection and repair
    - Cranialize/obliterate for damage to nasofrontal duct
    - <<Inner table fx of frontal sinus. Abx?>>


## Carotid or vertebral artery dissection
- Fracture traversing carotid canal
- Heparin gtt
- Antiplatelet therapy

## Diffuse Axonal Injury
Obtain MRI
- Grade I = only peripheral gray-white junction
- Grade II = injury to corpus callosum
- Grade III = injury to dorsolateral midbrain
