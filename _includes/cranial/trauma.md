# History:

- Time of injury
- Mechanism of injury
- Medications given en route
- Seizure, LOC
- Anticoagulant/antiplatelet

# Exam:

- GCS
- Pupils, cranial nerves (esp 3, 6, 7, 12)
- Strength, sensation, mental status
- Raccoon eyes, battle sign, hemotympanum, CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea
- Scalp lacerations

# Imaging: Head and C-spine CT

- Always check entire head CT for epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, parenchymal blood
- Midline shift, hydrocephalus, basal cisterns/subarachnoid spaces patent, gray/white differentiation
- Bone windows: Skull fractures? Fractures near carotids/temporal bone? Posterior frontal sinus? Orbits?
- Alignment of cervical spine/fractures. Facet dislocations? Teardrop fractures? Fishmouthing of disc spaces or spinous processes?

# Labs:

- Full set of labs, +/- tox screen/EtoH if older

# Plan:

- ABC's
- Does the patient need to go to the OR (?epidural hematoma +/-shift, subdural blood +/-mass effect, open/depressed skull fracture)
- Obtain CTA if fracture through carotid canal or foramen transversarium
- usually will have spine precautions until final CT review by attending radiologist (if no fracture)
- admit to ICU for 24 hours.  Floor for neuro-intact non-displaced skull fractures.
- If GCS less than 8, consider invasive ICP monitoring (make sure to have ICP monitor and box ready if can?t hit ventricle with ventric).  Goal CPP > 60, ICP < 25 (CPP = MAP ? ICP). See below for indications for invasive ICP monitoring
- HOB at 30 degrees (reverse Trendelenberg if spine not cleared)
- Avoid hypotonic solutions
- pCO2 goal 30-35 mmHg
- pO2 >100 mmHg
- cooling blanket for fever
- q 1 hour neuro checks
- Na >135
- Normalize PT, PTT and platelets > 80,000
- Anticonvulsant x 1 week if depressed skull fracture, immediate post-traumatic seizure, penetrating brain injury, or intracranial blood (Keppra 500 mg BID or 10 mg/kg BID)
- Page neurosurgery for change in neuro exam or elevated ICP
